# Falcon-7b-Talking-Like-Meera
I have uploaded the basic .ipynb file for the 7b model for people to train the model themselves as well as the trained model so one can generate outputs of their own. In addition im uploading my dataset.csv file which I used for training and my parser.py code for parsing the original text document into csv.
